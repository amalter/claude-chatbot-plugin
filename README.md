# ⚠️ Security Warning

This plugin uses the Claude API to answer questions about website content, but **lacks essential security measures**. It should **NOT** be used in production environments.

## Important Notes:

- This is a **proof of concept** only
- No input validation or sanitization
- No authentication mechanisms
- Potential data exposure risks
- API keys are not properly secured

This project serves as a starting point for development and learning purposes only. **Please implement proper security measures before considering any production use.** Use at your own risk, I am not liable for any unintentional damages that may come with implementing this code in your project.

Built using Cursor and Claude. Visit my [blog](https://www.amberalter.com/vibe-coding-a-chat-bot-my-experience/) for more details on this project.
